## web

### entangled-server

- 85 solves / 896 points

> ``` A NICC agent found an old abandoned server with some very suspicious files on it. We have found the file it was hosting on a webserver but it seems like it was very heavily obfuscated. Can you figure out how to get in? ```

> ``` The flag is located at /flag.txt on the server. ```

### paranormal-picture

- 266 solves / 50 points

> ``` One of our recruits is a massive conspiracy theorist. Strangely enough, he has expressed not only that everything is the bite of 87 but also that there's something strange going on in the dark web that involves Dr. Tom Lei. Though he is a little bit nuts, we think he may be on to something. Figure out what's going on before it's too late! ```

## bin

### Loab's House of Horrors Vol.I

- 98 solves / 588 points

> ``` It sounds like Loab is back and luring students into their trap. Thankfully Anna managed to rip the source code before Loab left the NJIT network. If we can find the flag we might be able to shut this down! ```

### what-flag

- 113 solves / 535 points

> ``` NICC recieved a mysterious email with an executable file that does nothing. Can you figure out what this executable does? ```

> ``` As Mary was attempting to time travel, she slipped on a patch of ice and landed on her butt. While getting up from the ice, she found a cool-looking USB flash drive containing a file with some system code. Can you help Mary decrypt what information the file has? ```

### B00fer

- 195 solves / 109 points

> ``` The Consortium sent us this file and connection info. Looks like they are taunting us. ```
